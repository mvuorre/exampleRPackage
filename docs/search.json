Standardization protocols sharing beneficial; , standards yet emerged. Instead developing another standard, suggest borrowing existing standards practices software engineering. Specifically, R package standard, additional R authoring tools, provides robust framework organizing sharing reproducible research products. advances data-sharing standards emerged: much psychological science now customary share data Open Science Framework (OSF). However, materials often contain idiosyncratic file organization minimal missing documentation raw data. specific areas, organization documentation standards emerged, (e.g., BIDS framework neuroscience, Gorgolewski et al. 2016), usually consider data code instead project whole. comprehensive proposals described Transparency Openness Promotion (Nosek et al. 2015), Peer Reviewers’ Openness initiative guidelines (Morey et al. 2016), fall short describing detailed standards organization metadata. sought standard organizing sharing adhere FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) guidelines maximize reuse potential data support “discovery good data management” (Wilkinson et al. 2016).
